/**********************************************
Exercise: Define a method that returns a formatted address
Create a method called MakeAddress that accepts parameters for the street, city , country, and postcode and returns a single address string.

For example if we call the method as follows:

MakeAddress("769 Kowhai Road", "Wellington", "New Zealand", "4205")

The return value would be

"You live at 769 Kowhai Road in the beautiful city of Wellington, New Zealand. Your postcode is 4205."

Note: the words your output that are not part of the method parameters must match exactly with the words in the output above.

//Initial solution

using System;

namespace Phase0_Exercise5_Format_Address
{
  public class Exercise5FormatAddress
    {
     public String MakeAddress(String street, String city, String country, int postcode)
     {
       String YourAddress "You live at" + street + "in the beautiful city of" + city + "," + country + ". Your postcode is" + postcode + ".";
     return YourAdress;
     }
    }
}


// Refactored solution

using System;

namespace Phase0_Exercise5_Format_Address
{
  public class Exercise5FormatAddress
    {
     public String MakeAddress(String street, String city, String country, String postcode)
     {
       String Address = "You live at " + street + " in the beautiful city of " + city + ", " + country + ". Your postcode is " + postcode + ".";
     return Address;
     }
    }
